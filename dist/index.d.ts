/**
 * The readers' public surface.
 *
 * Everything re-exported here is API: it is what a host is allowed to depend
 * on, and what cannot be changed without changing the host. Everything else in
 * this directory is internal and may be reshaped freely -- the text and link
 * layers, the find bar, the zoom cluster, the scroll memories, the WebKit
 * selection workaround, the markdown source map, the selection plumbing.
 *
 * Two tiers, because there are two ways to use these readers:
 *
 *   1. **Composed.** Mount a reader and drive it through the contract:
 *      `decorations` for host-owned marks, `slots` for host chrome, a `ref` for
 *      navigation, and `ReaderHostProvider` for the capabilities the readers
 *      need from the application around them.
 *
 *   2. **Headless.** Take the hooks and build your own surface. This is for a
 *      host whose reading surface is genuinely not a reader -- an annotated
 *      single-page stage, a thumbnail strip -- and which would otherwise
 *      reimplement document loading, page metrics and text location badly. It
 *      shares the engine without pretending to share the shell.
